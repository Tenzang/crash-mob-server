# Welcome to Crash Mob
## What is Crash Mob?
Crash Mob is an interactive table top role playing game character creation application
The Crash Mob Server was design to create a fully functioning back end API to store and feed data to the [Crash Mob client](https://github.com/Tenzang/crash-mob-client).

## Introduction
Using the knowledge that we learned from our immersive General Assembly course, we built our Ruby on Rails React Application with the brief that was given to us.

### Technologies used:
- *Ruby on Rails*
- *PostgreSQL*
- Deployed on *Heroku*

## Skills Used
Through an intense week of development, we used a lot of different skills specifically for the server side:
- Leveraged an understanding of MVC to:
    - prepare routes that accept API requests.
    - prepare controllers that connect to model and send retrieved data in JSON format.
    - prepare model that interfaces with PostgreSQL database to retrieve data.
- Configure application cors policy.
- Design database architecture with multiple association types e.g. *one to many*, *many to many*

#### TODO:
- Prepare database for client edit functionality
